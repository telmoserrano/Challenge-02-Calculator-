# Challenge-02-Calculator-

Hi there fellows!

This is a simple calculator I built, as a part of self-imposed challenges.

Feel free to comment on my code, as I am on my journey to learn how to shape my code in a more proper, cleaner and optimized way. 

Every opportunity to learn is a blessing, so please, don't be shy and share your thoughts!

Cheers,
Telmo
